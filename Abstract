The Pictogram Translation Challenge addresses the need for effective communication tools for Augmentative
and Alternative Communication (AAC) users. Text-to-Picto and Speech-to-Picto are the two subtasks that
comprise this challenge. The goal of the Text-to-Picto assignment is to automatically generate a list of terms
in pictograms from French text. This can be viewed as a translation challenge in which a series of French
pictogram terms is the target language and French is the source language. The Speech-to-Picto job eschews
the intermediate transcription stage and instead translates spoken French into pictogram concepts. In order to
meet the requirements for translations that AAC users can understand, participants must create solutions that
accurately map text and speech inputs to matching pictogram sequences. This challenge aims to increase the
usability and accessibility.
